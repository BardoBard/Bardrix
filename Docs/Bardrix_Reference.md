## Bardrix

Bardrix has a main header file that includes all the standard library headers and some important Bardrix headers. \
All other files within the Bardrix library should include this header file. \
It also defines `NODISCARD` and `INLINE` marcos as they are used throughout the library.

## Math

There are a few classes that are used for mathematics, these make the foundation of the library.

    - Parameterized constructor
        - Initializes the material to the given color, ambient, diffuse and shininess.
        - Initializes the material to the given color, ambient, diffuse, specular and shininess.
- Setters/Getters:
    - `set_ambient(ambient : double)`
        - Sets the ambience of the material.
        - **Degenerate cases**:
            - If the ambient is less than zero, it will be set to zero.
            - If the ambient is greater than one, it will be set to one.
    - `set_diffuse(diffuse : double)`
        - Sets the diffuseness of the material.
        - **Degenerate cases**:
            - If the diffuse is less than zero, it will be set to zero.
            - If the diffuse is greater than one, it will be set to one.
    - `set_specular(specular : double)`
        - Sets the specularness of the material.
        - **Degenerate cases**:
            - If the specular is less than zero, it will be set to zero.
            - If the specular is greater than one, it will be set to one.
    - `set_shininess(shininess : double)`
        - Sets the shininess of the material.
        - **Degenerate cases**:
            - If the shininess is less than one, it will be set to one.
    - `get_ambient()`
        - **Returns** the ambience of the material.
    - `get_diffuse()`
        - **Returns** the diffuseness of the material.
    - `get_specular()`
        - **Returns** the specularness of the material.
    - `get_shininess()`
        - **Returns** the shininess of the material.

### shape

Abstract class, only used for inheritance, serves as a base for all the shapes; like `sphere` and `triangle`. \
It has a material, position and a method to check if a ray intersects with the shape.

All methods are pure virtual, and must be implemented in the derived classes.

- Getters/Setters:
    - `set_material(material : material)`
        - Sets the material of the shape.
    - `set_material(material : material)`
        - Sets the material of the shape.
    - `get_material()`
        - **Returns** the material of the shape.
    - `get_position()`
        - **Returns** the position of the shape.
- Methods:
    - `intersect(ray : ray)`
        - Checks if the ray intersects with the shape and calculates the intersection point.
        - **Returns** an optional `point3` of the intersection point.
            - If the ray intersects with the shape, it should return the intersection point.
            - If the ray does not intersect with the shape, it should return an std::nullopt.
    - `normal_at(point : point3)`
        - Calculates the normal of the shape at the given point.
        - **Returns** the normal of the shape at the point.
